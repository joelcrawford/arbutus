    content: `<p>Arbutus is 
    comprised of <strong>Madelyn and Savannah Read</strong>, a 
    sister singer-songwriter duo from Vancouver, 
    BC. They play a mixture of original compositions 
    and innovative covers that span the genres of 
    folk and alternative pop. They have been 
    performing together for over 10 years 
    (yes, since Savannah was 7 years old) and never 
    fail to deliver impossibly tight sibling vocal 
    harmonies. Normally, you can catch them playing 
    at farmers markets and cafes around Vancouver, 
    but this summer theyâ€™ll be touring their new EP 
    (out August 2019) across the country.`
