                    <p>Arbutus is 
                    comprised of <strong>Madelyn and Savannah Read</strong>, a 
                    sister singer-songwriter duo from Vancouver, 
                    BC. They play a mixture of original compositions 
                    and innovative covers that span the genres of 
                    folk and alternative pop. They have been 
                    performing together for over 10 years 
                    (yes, since Savannah was 7 years old) and never 
                    fail to deliver impossibly tight sibling vocal 
                    harmonies. Normally, you can catch them playing 
                    at farmers markets and cafes around Vancouver, 
                    but this summer theyâ€™ll be touring their new EP 
                    (out August 2019) across the country. </p>
